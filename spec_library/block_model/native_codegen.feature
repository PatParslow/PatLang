Feature: real native codegen for the block-model IR (Block Ownership Model, Fork A, Phase 9)

  Phase 9 (docs/plans/block-ownership-model-implementation-plan.md): the
  native half of Fork A's "front to back" -- self_hosting/block_model/
  native_codegen.patlang translates a BlockProgramIR into a single, real,
  flat FuncIR (blocks concatenated, JumpBlock expanded into ordinary
  Store instructions plus a real Jump), then reuses self_hosting/lib/
  codegen_x64.patlang's own, already-proven emit_program_x64 for
  everything else -- no new x64 emission code, no interpretation of the
  block-model IR at runtime at all. A real two-chunk build (mirroring
  self_hosting/build_x64_runtime.patlang's own established convention),
  linking against the already-built self_hosting/build/x64_runtime.obj,
  not a single bundled-source chunk (tried first, abandoned after
  codegen_x64.patlang's own hardcoded runtime-call asm text for
  overflow-checked arithmetic made textual renaming unsafe).

  A real bug was found and fixed building this, not just designed
  around in advance: JumpBlock expands into MULTIPLE instructions (a
  Store per forwarded value, plus a Jump), so a JumpIfFalse/Jump target
  computed against the original, one-JumpBlock-is-one-instruction
  numbering does not equal its own position in the expanded output --
  a loop's own JumpIfFalse landed mid-way through its own back edge's
  Store sequence instead of at the exit block's own, producing a
  genuine infinite loop. Fixed with a per-block index map from original
  instruction position to its own expanded position.

  Scenario: a loop-free, two-block program runs correctly through real native codegen
    Given a program that jumps from one block to another, forwarding two values
    When it is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then it prints the correct result

  Scenario: a small loop runs correctly and terminates
    Given a loop of a known, small iteration count
    When it is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then it prints the correct sum and the process exits cleanly, not hanging

  Scenario: the same loop shape at a much larger scale still matches the interpreted result
    Given the same benchmark loop used for the engine's own speed comparison, at N=800000
    When it is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then it prints the exact value every other execution path (interpreted, bi_run-compiled) already agreed on

  Scenario: block-to-block control flow compiles to real jumps, never calls
    Given the assembly emitted for the small loop above
    When the instructions between block labels are inspected directly
    Then every transfer of control between blocks is an ordinary jmp, with no call/ret introducing a call stack that was never there in the design

  Scenario: fact/query/type_of/read_file/write_file compile through real native codegen (Phase 19)
    Given a program using fact, query, type_of, write_file, and read_file
    When it is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then each one produces the exact same result the interpreter already gives

  Scenario: a failing require aborts through real native codegen, exiting with a nonzero code (Phase 19)
    Given a program whose require fails
    When it is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then it aborts with the same guaranteed-fail message the interpreter gives, and a nonzero exit code

  A real, project-wide bug was found and fixed while proving this, not
  designed around in advance: without `-Wl,--disable-dynamicbase`,
  Windows can relocate a linked image away from the fixed 0x140000000
  base `x64_family_code_asm`'s own classification logic hardcodes
  (needed to distinguish a string literal's `.data` address from a
  plain int) -- confirmed via a hand-instrumented raw address dump
  showing the actual runtime address far outside
  [0x140000000, 0x150000000), silently misclassifying every string
  constant as "other"/"int" and corrupting `print()`'s own dispatch for
  it. Fixed in `self_hosting/lib/x64_build.patlang` (every linker call
  site) and `self_hosting/block_model/tools/build_and_run_native.sh` --
  not block-model-specific, affects any native build linking more than
  one object file where the OS happens to relocate it.

  `fiber_yield` compiles but segfaults when called with no active fiber
  context established (no prior `fiber_new`/`fiber_resume`) -- a real,
  separate, deliberately out-of-scope finding for this pass, not
  silently papered over: a bare native smoke test with no fiber
  machinery around it isn't a valid usage pattern for it, matching the
  scoping this whole feature's Phase 19 slice already commits to.

  Scenario: Global*/Handler* compile through real native codegen, as hand-emitted assoc-list loops (Phase 19)
    Given a program using set_global/get_global across a jump chain, and a handler with two names registered
    When each is built and run as a real, fully native executable
    Then both produce the exact same result the interpreter already gives

  A real, previously-undiscovered bug in this same new code was found
  and fixed proving the scenario above, not designed around in advance:
  `rt_list_push(l, v)` (list argument first, value second) had its two
  arguments pushed in the WRONG order in three call sites inside the
  hand-emitted `HandlerRegister`/`GlobalSet` loop -- corrupting the
  handler's own backing list via `rt_list_push`'s own address/length
  read against the wrong operand, which surfaced as a genuine, real
  segfault the moment the loop actually ran with at least one entry to
  examine, not as a subtly wrong result. Found via systematically
  narrowing a minimal repro (a single `handler_register` followed by
  one `handler_lookup`), not by inspection alone.
